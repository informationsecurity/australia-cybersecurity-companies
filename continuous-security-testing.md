# Continuous Security Testing in Australia in 2025: the best providers to test resilience in real-time

In 2025, cyber threats evolve at such a pace that periodic security tests are insufficient. Companies that truly want to be resilient must move from a "snapshot" approach to a **continuous** model, capable of detecting and mitigating vulnerabilities the moment they appear.

**Continuous Security Testing (CST)** represents this new paradigm: a mix of penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, behavioral analysis, and attack simulations conducted **continuously**, integrated into DevOps and SOC processes.

This guide presents the **10 best Continuous Security Testing providers in Australia in 2025**, focusing on methodology, integration, verticalization, and response capabilities.
